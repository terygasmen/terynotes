        </section>

        <p>Our world today pushes us to embrace the blights that come with our humanness. This includes an inaccurate notion of love and happiness. We are increasingly normalizing sex before marriage, consuming pornography (in whatever form it takes) as a tool to satisfy sexual cravings, and defiling our bodies in self-indulgent ways. More and more, we are losing sight of the gift we were given when we elected to follow Jesus Christ as our savior.</p>
        <p>The persistent reminder of our bodiless nature in the premortal existence should be present. We know the Father to be in possession of flesh and bones, just as Jesus Christ did during and after His human experience. Now, we are given our own and the chance to keep and perfect them in the next life. Satan is well aware of this. He realizes that the only way to demolish Heavenly Father's plan is to corrupt what mankind thinks of these eternal gifts. Because once these are gone, it's all downhill from there.
        </p>
        <p>As we begin to perceive our bodies as nothing more than objects that will rot when we die, we begin to diminish the importance of its purpose. And with this faulty understanding, we lose sight of the holiness and strength of love, especially one between a married man and woman. We lose sight of the value and power within families.
        </p>
        <p>This downward spiral of apostasy starts with just a single thread of regarded temptation. Divorce, teenage pregnancy, broken families, purely intimate relationship with nothing more than acquaintancy as a connection, and many more unpleasant outcomes are higher than ever in this day and age.  
        </p>
        <p>This is why the greatest attribute exemplified by our Savior is chastity. It is the single most potent teacher that breeds respect, love and admiration for our temples, which in turn, instills respect, love and admiration for other people and all the wonderful things the come with it, such as marriage, family and harmonious communities.
        </p>
        <p>Pornography has grown so ubiquitous in our society that children as young as 4 years old are now exposed to it. It is harder than ever to become worthy of the companionship of His spirit, which is the only guide we need to navigate through the pitfalls of our mortal existence. The world is beset with the voice of Satan and no longer can we hear the soft and quiet warnings of the Holy Ghost that keeps us away from this perilous path to apostasy. Pornography may seem harmless at first but it will shift, warp and distort your ability to gain a perspective that's eternal. It defies all worth you place on yourself and the people around you.
        </p>
        <p>While the reality that combating this addiction is difficult remains, we must wake up and realize that this isn't something new to us. This is yet another of Satan's diversions designed to derail the plan for mankind's redemption. Righteously restraint from the deceptive pleasures of the natural self will benefit us more than we can fathom. This emanates from our persistent yearning to learn more about God's nature, which teaches us more about ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>We've learned countless times that our favorite sins will not save us. If we don't give it up, it may be too late to turn things around. There is only one person who can save us, and that is Jesus Christ. There isn't anything else. The more we embrace this truth and nurture it in our hearts and spirits, the easier it is to avoid anything that detracts from it.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, nobody should ever feel ashamed of being tempted into pornography. We are all under the thumb of our natural man and Satan. It is in the way we fight them and stand on the principles of the gospel that we evolve from this poison.
