        <h1>the holy ghost as a dove</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>2 nephi 31:8</strong></p>
            <p>Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove.</p>
        </blockquote>
            <p>first off, i think it&#39;s helpful that we establish what we already know about the holy ghost. it is the third member of the godhead, and the only one of three who doesn&#39;t possess a body; and for a very significant reason--so he can readily dwell in temples (or our bodies).</p>
            <p>we do know about his function and role in the godhead. besides uniting with heavenly father and jesus christ for the plan of salvation to come to fruition, his primary responsibility is to testify of the first two members.</p>
            <p>with that aside, i want to provide one more account in which the holy ghost was personified as a dove. in <em>genesis 8</em>, we follow noah dispatching a dove to find out if the flood has abated. the first one returned because it &quot;...found no rest for the sole of her foot. (<em>genesis 8:9</em>)&quot; noah tried a second time, and the dove he sent out came back with a leaf in its beak, confirming the beginning of the end of the great flood (<em>genesis 8:11</em>). </p>
            <p>what happens next is staggering. noah waited seven days before dispatching the third dove. the dove did not return this time (<em>genesis 8:12</em>). we don&#39;t take this as a bad news. we look at it as the dove finding a new home in the freshly baptized earth.</p>
            <p>i&#39;d like to sit this account beside Jesus&#39; baptism in <em>2 nephi 31</em> since the ordinance of baptism happened in both (although one is literal and the other is symbolical). in the covenant path, we know baptism to be succeeded by the confirmation of the holy ghost.</p>
            <p>when someone accepts the gospel in his/her life, it necessitates a rebirth, a fresh start. in the waters of baptism, we leave the transgression of adam and eve so we can be as a newborn. when we perform the ordinance of the conformation of the holy ghost, we are endowed with its companionship, which incidentally confirms the goodness of the path one&#39;s about to take when living the new life. in this new life, we are promised peace and happiness. just like the dove that found a new home in the new earth, we take it as an implication that the new journey ahead will grant us peace and happiness.</p>
            <p>when we read through the four gospels in the new testament canon, we do get one more indication on the holy spirit as a dove. </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>matthew 10:16</strong></p>
            <p>Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</p>
        </blockquote>
            <p>look at these animals Jesus used to denote attributes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>sheep</strong> - purity</li>
            <li><strong>wolves</strong> - wickedness</li>
            <li><strong>serpents</strong> - wisdom</li>
            <li><strong>doves</strong> - innocence</li>
        </ul>
            <p>additionally, we know sheep to be a symbol of the purity of jesus christ, but doves were also used as sacrifices in the taberbacles and temples. there are, of course, other symbols to characterize the holy ghost. with its many attributes, the authors of the books we read in the scriptures, along with heavenly father and jesus christ, use them distinctly to make a point. for instance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>wind</strong> - invisible but vital</li>
            <li><strong>fire</strong> - powerful</li>
        </ul>
        <p>so i think it's safe to infer that among the many earthly symbols used to signify the Holy Ghost, it is a symbol of purity and innocence for anyone who has made the decision to follow jesus christ in his footsteps to perfection.</p>
