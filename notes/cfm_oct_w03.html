                <h2>the book of jeremiah üìñ</h2>
        <p>coming from the book of isaiah, the book of jeremiah is the lesser known account (at least for BOM readers since isaiah is the most quoted prophet by all of BOM prophets) that succeeds the scattering of israel through the assyrian conquest. in this book, we&#39;re treading towards the part two of the scattering through the babylonian conquest. </p>
        <p>we have just come from the destruction of the northern kingdom of israel, samaria, which contained the 10 tribes of israel (now called the ten lost tribes). we had a prophet named isaiah whose entire ministry was about the destruction of judah, or jerusalem, its great capital city. and about a hundred and thirty years later, with prophet isaiah gone, babylon is here as the new evil empire that follows the footsteps of assyria.</p>
        <p>i&#39;ll give three reasons why the book of jeremiah is a great book of interest among the many who are interested in the israelite history and in OT-BOM interrelations:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the book of jeremiah is officially the longest book in the whole biblical canon.</li>
            <li>it records the second and most important part of the scattering of israel.</li>
            <li>it is the entryway by which the BOM enters into view.</li>
            <li>jeremiah is a contemporary of lehi.</li>
        </ol>

            <section>
                <h2>jeremiah the prophet üêë</h2>
        <p>jeremiah is the son of hilkiah, a priest in anathoth, benjamin (<em>jeremiah 1:1</em>). he is the succeeding prophet of isaiah. he comes in about 130 years after isaiah&#39;s prophecy of jerusalem&#39;s destruction.</p>
        <p>his ministry starts from the 13th year of king josiah&#39;s reign until the 11th year of king zedekiah&#39;s reign. in total, his ministry covered 5 kings of judah--king josiah, 3 of king josiah&#39;s sons, jehoahaz, jehoiakim, and zedekiah, and one of his grandsons, jehoiachin. (<em>jeremiah 1:2-3</em>)</p>
        <p>he is one of the major prophets (meaning his book has one of the longest running length in the entire OT canon), with his book, the book of jeremiah, the longest book in the entire biblical canon. and interestingly, scholars refer to him as &quot;the weeping prophet.&quot;</p>

            <section>
                <h2>foreordination üèπ</h2>
        <p>after the first four verses in the first chapter of jeremiah, we are immediately introduced to one of those doctrines that were only recently explicated in the latter days (with brigham young as the pioneer). it is the doctrine of foreordination.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 1:4-5 NLT</strong></p>
        <p>4 The LORD gave me this message:</p>
        <p>5 ‚ÄúI knew you before I formed you in your mother‚Äôs womb. Before you were born I set you apart and appointed you as my prophet to the nations.‚Äù</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>briefly, foreordination is one of the agendas that happened in the staple event of the grand council in heaven. it states that all who have had, have or will have their own callings were already called or ordained in the premortal existence, and they have their agency to fulfill these callings during their mortal existence, with agency as its contrasting factor from predestination.</p>
        <p>so in this verse, we have the lord comforting the prophet jeremiah of his brand-new calling. in the succeeding verse, we will see jeremiah&#39;s reaction to it.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 1:6 NLT</strong></p>
        <p>6 ‚ÄúO Sovereign LORD,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speak for you! I‚Äôm too young!‚Äù</p></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>sidebar: there&#39;s this natural man pattern of newly called prophets that i&#39;m grateful dr. john hilton iii brought into my view (this is from the follow him podcast with hank smith and john bytheway). it&#39;s these reactions we have when faced with a great challenge. </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>moses - &quot;i&#39;m slow of speech!&quot;</li>
            <li>enoch - &quot;i&#39;m only a lad. all the people hate me!&quot;</li>
            <li>isaiah - &quot;i&#39;m a man of unclean lips!&quot;</li>
            <li>jeremiah - &quot;i&#39;m only a child!&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>and i love how the lord deals with this kind of reaction, just as how he always deals with our imperfections: he doesn&#39;t tell us what we want to hear, he instead imparts to us the knowledge and the doctrine that supplements those worries, fears and insecurities, which not only comforts us but also validates our identity and potential. </p>
        <p>what he gives us are founded on an everlasting and unalterable truth, which hopefully teaches us a lesson on how to lift up our brothers and sisters when they&#39;re sad, lonely, hopeless or in despair. his approach is neither pampering nor tough love. it&#39;s wisdom. and this tells us what kind of person our god is. he is good and all-knowing.</p>
        
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>how does the knowledge of foreordination bless our lives? üåü</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>TPJS, p.365</strong></p>
        <p>every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the grand council of heaven before this world was. i suppose i was ordained to this very office in that grand council.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>the knowledge of foreordination is a vital doctrine in our church as it ultimately does these things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>it indicates that there is indeed life before mortality which incidentally proves there&#39;s another one after.</li>
            <li>gives us strength to fulfill our own callings.</li>
            <li>the grand council that occurred in the premortal life is an inclusion of all god&#39;s children in the gathering of israel.</li>
            <li>simply proves that salvation is true and attainable.</li>
            <li>makes it easier for every member to sustain and follow our church leaders.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>personally, i&#39;m always stunned with the inclusion of everybody in the grand council, sustaining the  perfect candidates for the different callings and missions--positions that determine the trajectory of mankind in this mortal world. this gives me a window to a past decision i have done and the person i was in my premortal state. and now in my mortal state, i feel more confident in the called and ordained church leaders through the different time periods as they closed the gap of communication and knowledge between heaven and earth. but i digress üòó</p>
        
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>what do prophets in our day &quot;root out&quot; or &quot;pull down&quot;? what do they &quot;build&quot; and &quot;plant&quot;? ‚õèÔ∏èü•Ä</h2>
        <p>this question is from the come follow me manual and i encourage you to ponder and answer this one on your own.</p>
        <p>different dispensations and ministries call for different sets of missions and knowledge. in these latter days, specifically the year 2000 when 
        i was born to the present, i have personally witnessed the decline of people desiring or even seeing the value in marriage and family. this is a big one for me and for the members of the church as we are stemming from the whole concept of exaltation (i actually made a whole post about this. ultimately, i talked about the role of collectivity in salvation, on the premise of exaltation, how it works and what it looks like).</p>
        <p>there&#39;s a steady increase of the pursuit of material things and successful careers. there&#39;s a rise in bitterness, toxicity and negativity; in the exploitation of our natural resources and neglect or even acknowledgment for the state of our planet; of mental health issues, emotional manipulation, unfaithfulness, lying and deceit; of the defiling of our bodies through different fashion trends, beauty standards and extreme diets; and more.</p>
        <p>and of course our ignorance is a huge player in this. it is only through knowledge that we gain a perspective that&#39;s not short-sighted, a lifestyle that&#39;s not self-indulgent, and a mindset that&#39;s founded in integrity and faithfulness. let me illustrate my point in these verses:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>isaiah 52:5-6</strong></p>
        <p>5 Now therefore, what have I here, saith the Lord, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the Lord; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.</p>
        <p>6 Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in the day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>as heartbreaking these verses are, we can find a valuable lesson in breaking them down into two parts: the problem and the solution. the problem is that these people are wicked and unrighteous. they blaspheme his name and mock his whole mission. they have completely descended into chaos and misery, deluded in their own idea of truth. and jesus was not happy about this. he&#39;s not happy about their spiritual state. in fact, he&#39;s grieving for what they have turned into.</p>
        <p>we go to the next verse where he tells us the solution to this ignorance: knowledge. the case is that their spiritual state stems from their lack of knowledge of their god and savior. to them, this man is another phony who self-elected his place to chastise their lifestyle and choices. these people simply do not know who he is. verse 6 tells us that come the future, when he returns as a resurrected and perfected being, the people shall know him and his name. they shall have that knowledge and they will hold on to it for their salvation.</p>
        <p>which now brings me to the important role of prophets in a world that&#39;s going further and further into destruction. there is only one driver of everything, and that is love. the plan of salvation, the atonement of jesus christ, the second coming of jesus christ, the allowance of salvation and perfection in the next life--they all came to fruition because of this driver. and that&#39;s essentially why we have prophets in every dispensation, to remind us what love is and all that manifested because of it.</p>
        <p>when we learn how to love properly and use this driver to live a righteous life, we will understand the value in families and the friendships we form with the people around us. we stop chasing after careers and fashion trends and beauty standards that will keep changing and contradicting. we will take responsibility of our stewardship to this beautiful planet. we take down all forms of negativity and lift each other up. we become faithful and honest to the ones we love. we build strong and faithful families that rise to the future generations.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>israel&#39;s cistern is filled ü•õ</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 2:13 NLT</strong></p>
        <p>13 For my people have done two evil things: They have abandoned me--the fountain of living water. And they have dug themselves cracked cisterns that can hold no water at all!</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>one of the prime symbols in the scripture canons is the fountain of living waters, where anybody can come and draw endless power and strength. fountains are known for their consistent and perennial flow and abundance, as opposed to cisterns where their capacity have a limit and the water can dry up and turn stale. to further clarify this symbol, i&#39;ll pull two scripture verses from the NT and BOM.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>revelation 7:17</strong></p>
        <p>17 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>in this verse, we learn that <strong>jesus christ is the path</strong> that leads toward this fountain.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>1 nephi 11:25</strong></p>
        <p>25 And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love of God.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>and in this verse, we learn that this <strong>fountain is the love of god</strong> which we know is unconditional and eternal.</p>
        <p>so israel made two wrong moves that ultimately led to the destruction of jerusalem. the word &quot;abandoned&quot; in <em>jeremiah 2:13</em> implies that the love and favor of the lord towards israel never departed nor ceased, and the part where it says &quot;they have dug themselves cracked cisterns&quot; shows that israel was the one who haphazardly turned disloyal and deliberately sought other gods. </p>
        <p>let me quote here a sidebar from hank smith in the podcast, follow him:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>...the Savior told a great parable about this when he said there was a house that had an evil spirit and they casted the evil spirit out and then it returns with seven of its friends because the house wasn&#39;t full of anything else. The sins returned with even more sins, with even more friends...</p>
            </blockquote>
    
            <p>this is the great danger in trying to shift from a mindset/behavior to another. this is essentially what norman v. peale emphasized since it&#39;s such a simple error to make: while you&#39;re attempting to eradicate negative thought patterns in your brain, you can&#39;t leave it vacant. immediately, you fill it with positive thought patterns; otherwise, it becomes an empty vessel into which wrong thoughts might enter and inhabit. </p>
            <p>this is almost comparable to israel&#39;s futile attempts to jump on two branches, thinking they can get away with it in the eyes the one true god.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>jeremiah 7:4-11</strong></p>
            <p>4 Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, are these.</p>
            <p>5 For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;</p>
            <p>6 If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:</p>
            <p>7 Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>8 Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.</p>
            <p>9 Will ye steal, amurder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;</p>
            <p>10 And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?</p>
            <p>11 Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the Lord.</p>
            </blockquote>
    
            <p>and i like to place these lines next to each other in <em>isaiah 29:13-14</em> where the lord describes the mismatch between what the israelites were practicing and what they were doing. i love this because isaiah and jeremiah are two completely different guys. we get isaiah who loves to articulate in beautiful prose and jeremiah who loves plainness like nephi. but their message is fundamentally the same. israel is preoccupied with their idol worships and violence and oppression so the spirit of the lord simply cannot dwell with them even when they go to the temple and worship him on sabbath days.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>jeremiah, &quot;the weeping prophet&quot; üò≠</h2>
            <p>interestingly, jeremiah is referred to as &quot;the weeping prophet&quot; by some scholars. we find a fascinating narrative in chapters 11 and 12 where we see jeremiah battle with a crisis of his calling and capabilities, and comes to the lord to mourn. this reminds me of the entire book of job as job interrogates and almost berates the lord for all of his unfortunate circumstances. but to give you context, we read here what the calling and mission has brought to jeremiah&#39;s life.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>jeremiah 11:21, 12:6 NLT</strong></p>
            <p>21 This is what the LORD says about the men of Anathoth who wanted me dead. They had said, &quot;We will kill you if you do not stop prophesying in the LORD&#39;s name.&quot;</p>
            <p>12 Even your brothers, members of your own family, have turned against you. They plot and raise complains against you. Do not trust them, no matter how pleasantly they speak.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>jeremiah 12:1-4</strong></p>
                <p>1 LORD, you always give me justice when I bring a case before you. So let me bring you this complaint: Why are the wicked so prosperous? Why are evil people so happy?</p>
                <p>2 You have planted them, and they have taken root and prospered. Your name is on their lips, but you are far from their hearts.</p>
                <p>3 But as for me, LORD, you know my heart. You see me and test my thoughts. Drag these people away like sheep to be butchered! Set them aside to be slaughtered!</p>
                <p>4 How long must this land mourn? Even the grass in the fields has withered. The wild animals and birds have disappeared because of the evil in the land. For the people have said, ‚ÄúThe LORD doesn‚Äôt see what‚Äôs ahead for us!‚Äù</p>
                </blockquote>
        
                <p>and the lord responds with:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                <p><strong>jeremiah 12:5</strong></p>
                <p>5 If racing against mere men makes you tired, how will you race against horses? If you stumble and fall on open ground, what will you do in the thickets near the Jordan?</p>
                </blockquote>
        
                <p>the lord gives us a disheartening response. and there&#39;s really nothing he can do. he knows what&#39;s ahead of jerusalem and its people. he knows what occurs throughout jeremiah&#39;s ministry. he had sent prophets to foretell what exactly will happen in the coming years of jeremiah&#39;s new calling. but jeremiah continues:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                <p><strong>jeremiah 12:15-18</strong></p>
                <p>15 Then I said, ‚Äú LORD, you know what‚Äôs happening to me. Please step in and help me. Punish my persecutors! Please give me time; don‚Äôt let me die young. It‚Äôs for your sake that I am suffering.</p>
                <p>16 When I discovered your words, I devoured them. They are my joy and my heart‚Äôs delight, for I bear your name, O LORD God of Heaven‚Äôs Armies.</p>
                <p>17 I never joined the people in their merry feasts. I sat alone because your hand was on me. I was filled with indignation at their sins.</p>
                <p>18 Why then does my suffering continue? Why is my wound so incurable? Your help seems as uncertain as a seasonal brook, like a spring that has gone dry.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>people in anathoth, benjamin want him dead for all of his prophesying and chastisement. on top of that, his family doesn&#39;t believe him and has completely abandoned him. so jeremiah cries:</p>
        
        

        <p>and it&#39;s only then do we receive a comforting response from the lord--that jeremiah&#39;s safety is assured. he may continue to prophesy unto the people of jerusalem and they will continue to endanger his life and go sideways:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 12:19-21</strong></p>
        <p>19 This is how the LORD responds: ‚ÄúIf you return to me, I will restore you so you can continue to serve me. If you speak good words rather than worthless ones, you will be my spokesman. You must influence them; do not let them influence you!</p>
        <p>20  They will fight against you like an attacking army, but I will make you as secure as a fortified wall of bronze. They will not conquer you, for I am with you to protect and rescue you. I, the LORD, have spoken!</p>
        <p>21 Yes, I will certainly keep you safe from these wicked men. I will rescue you from their cruel hands.‚Äù</p>

        <p><strong>jeremiah 16:14-18 NLT</strong></p>

        <p>15 Instead, they will say, ‚ÄòAs surely as the LORD lives, who brought the people of Israel back to their own land from the land of the north and from all the countries to which he had exiled them.‚Äô For I will bring them back to this land that I gave their ancestors.</p>
        <p>16 But now I am sending for many fishermen who will catch them,‚Äù says the LORD . ‚ÄúI am sending for hunters who will hunt them down in the mountains, hills, and caves.</p>

        <p>14 He says, ‚ÄòI will build a magnificent palace with huge rooms and many windows. I will panel it throughout with fragrant cedar and paint it a lovely red.‚Äô</p>
        <p>15 But a beautiful cedar palace does not make a great king! Your father, Josiah, also had plenty to eat and drink. But he was just and right in all his dealings. That is why God blessed him.</p>
        <p>16 He gave justice and help to the poor and needy, and everything went well for him. Isn‚Äôt that what it means to know me?‚Äù says the LORD.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>the lord likens king jehoiakim to his father, josiah, one of judah&#39;s righteous kings. jehoiakim is constructing his palace through slave labor while josiah lived modestly, devoting his time and energy to his people. this, according to the lord, is what it means to know him. no longer will you chase after the wrong things nor dedicate your precious time and energy to things that won&#39;t matter in eternity. </p>
        <p>in continuation to &quot;the weeping prophet&quot; section, in chapter 20, we get a scene of jeremiah reluctantly quitting his calling. he cried to the lord, saying:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 20:7-9 NLT</strong></p>
        <p>7 O LORD, you misled me, and I allowed myself to be misled. You are stronger than I am, and you overpowered me. Now I am mocked every day; everyone laughs at me.</p>
        <p>8 When I speak, the words burst out. ‚ÄúViolence and destruction!‚Äù I shout. So these messages from the LORD have made me a household joke.</p>
        <p>9 But if I say I‚Äôll never mention the LORD or speak in his name, his word burns in my heart like a fire. It‚Äôs like a fire in my bones! I am worn out trying to hold it in! I can‚Äôt do it!</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>the last verse here really is the watershed moment for jeremiah. it&#39;s such a powerful testimony. after all the mocking, the ridiculing, the oppression, the threats, and the abandonment from his loved ones, he absolutely cannot give up. he knows too much of the truth now, that it&#39;s impossible for him to keep living with it by the wayside.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>meditations, marcus aurelius</strong></p>
        <p> When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can&#39;t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil...></p>

        <p>through this knowledge, the gospel comes in in one&#39;s life and changes it. change is what the gospel brings about. when we allow his hand to touch us, our lives change. when we allow his hand over our lips, we have his words; his hand over our hands, we have his strength; his hand over our hearts, we have his love. all he is is power.</p>
