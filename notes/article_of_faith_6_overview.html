        <p>The <em>Article of Faith 6</em> states that our church is founded on the same essential constituents as the primitive church. this principle continually and eternally supports the truth that God never changes. He has one law and this law existed long before we did.</p>
        <p>Our mortality presents gaps in our knowledge and character which can only be filled by anchoring our lives on the gospel of Jesus Christ. These gaps do not fixate on the shortcomings of our natural state, but instead, contend for growth and goodness. This is what opposition is for (<em>Isaiah 30:20-21</em>). These pushing and pulling forces in our mortal journey stretch and strengthen us and eventually turn us into masterpieces just as how a blacksmith forges a clump of metal into a formidable sword. </p>
        <p>Let us establish once again the powerful and unconditional love that Heavenly Father has for us. He does not feast over our shortcomings, errors, anxieties, ignorance and infirmities. He does not enjoy watching us suffer the repercussions of our poor choices. He derives no pleasure and satisfaction from punishing us. He instead lets the law work because it is the only way that redemption is granted. It is the only way He can help us return home safely one day. (<em>James 1:25</em>)</p>
        <p>It is too tempting to fall into the mindset of compartmentalizing our spiritual life as if it&#39;s just another facet in our overall entity. It&#39;s too tempting to believe that the Sabbath Day is the only day we can give our all to the Lord (<em>Doctrine and Covenants 20:55</em>); and once we&#39;re outside of the church, as the rest of the week rolled on, it&#39;s too easy to think our time is now for the world. But to break this habit of electing time, place and hats for our different life affairs, we must remember that we were spirits long before we were humans, and that we won&#39;t be humans for long.</p>
        <p>We have transformed from bodiless souls to mortal and imperfect beings to becoming immortal and perfect gods/goddesses come the future. These transformative points of our continuous existence are only the evolution of our very first entity--our soul. But just like Jesus Christ&#39;s path to perfection, our souls will only evolve. Our entities will only evolve through this fixed and unalterable law. The Lord can only extend His patience, understanding, grace and mercy, but never bend the law that allows for infinite happiness and peace.</p>
