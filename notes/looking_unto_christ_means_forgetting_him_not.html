        <p>Looking unto Christ and remembering Him in all that we do may be pretty daunting. It can be rather excessive to continuously center Him in our thoughts, emotions and decisions throughout our lives. But I believe there&#39;s a another way to look at it.</p>
        <p>For starters, the Lord is the source of all intelligence. All the goods things, both spiritual and secular, that we benefit from in this natural world stemmed from this source. Even though human philosophies, sciences, medicine and technology--the biggest disciplines of knowledge in our contemporary world--were founded by one person or a group of people who&#39;ve devoted their whole lives to furthering humanity, they are merely discoverers of knowledge that&#39;s already existing somewhere (and of course, this is not to discredit them for their contributions and their genius).</p>
        <p>These pieces of knowledge emerged from only one source. This abundant and eternal stream is the one from which Jesus Christ welcomes and encourages us to draw from. So with this in mind, I think that a lot of the things we do, the choices we make, and the thoughts we possess, are already the products of the values, beliefs and principles we allow in our identity. And someone who&#39;s baptized in His church has received the companionship of His Spirit which allows for the their remembrance of Him, among many other things.</p>
        <p>Intentionally recognizing our Savior can be different in that it requires greater effort to ensure that the reverse does not occur--to &quot;forget Him&quot;. </p>
        <p>We may establish first that the only things preventing us from obeying this commandment are our natural man and Satan. For a person who&#39;s already living a gospel-centered life, it is only in those moments that he/she allows these two entities to overtake that he/she steps outside of the influence of the Holy Ghost.</p>
        <p>When we look at it this way, what Jesus Christ is essentially asking from us is to stay away from our natural way of thinking and the voice of Satan so as to not &quot;forget Him&quot;. It is in the reckless and thoughtless minuscule choices that we do that we forget Him. Only then will His Spirit guide us with ease according to the measure of our faith and humility, which eventually, leads to our continual remembrance of Him.</p>
        
        <h2>what makes the Church different from others? üèõ</h2>
        <p>I really love the talk, &quot;Our Most Distinguishing Feature.&quot; The priesthood is what permits His kingdom to function in our natural world. Other religious denominations simply don&#39;t have this. It is this priesthood that brought the emergence of the many fundamental constituents of the Church--the Book of Mormon, the living prophets, modern church revelations, greater understanding on the gospel of Jesus Christ (the plan of salvation, the existence of pre- and post-mortal life, the Millennium, etc.) and many more to come.</p>
