            <h2>the entrance of the covenant path üõ£Ô∏è</h2>
        <p>If we break down the <em>Article of Faith 4</em>, we get these four foundational aspects of the gospel:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Faith in Jesus Christ</li>
            <li>Repentance</li>
            <li>Baptism by water</li>
            <li>Baptism by fire</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The words <em>first principles and ordinances</em> indicate that these four things lead you as far as the entrance to the covenant path, and that&#39;s it. However, if we dissect what these principles really stand for in essence, we know them to be sitting at the very core of our membership to the Church and our discipleship to Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>I think that contained within these principles are substantial and distinctive doctrinal truths that gradually build on top of each other, and each of these truths are worth learning about in this lifetime.</p>

            <h2>faith lifts the veil ‚õÖ</h2>
        <p>To start off, there is a veil that separates earth from heaven which conceals the grand and panoramic universe of intelligence. This veil walls mortals from immortals, men from god, imperfection from perfection, relative truth from complete truth, etc. (<em>Moses 7:61</em>)</p>
        <p>This great gap can only be bridged by going out from our human instincts and fight the ever-present battle with our natural man--the one that fails, that incorrectly judges, and that lacks wisdom and knowledge.</p>
        <p>We do this through this small and singular thing called faith (<em>Matthew 17:20</em>). This substance is the entryway by which the gospel comes in in one&#39;s life. Once a person is in possession of this, he/she has already entered a higher plane of existence, bridging the gap between earth and heaven.</p>
        <p>It is the beginning of everything good. It is the beginning of knowledge, which invites hope, which then invites joy, then peace, and then ultimately, happiness. It is the very first layer of godliness.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>the atonement of jesus christ ü©∏</h2>
        <p>This brings me to the surest foundation of one&#39;s faith--Jesus Christ, or more specifically, the Atonement of Jesus Christ. He is the one who holds our hands in our journey through godliness (<em>Doctrine and Covenants 59:23</em>). He is the center of everything. Not only did He atone for the whole mankind&#39;s sins, He laid out the path towards salvation and He personally went through it. This foundation is the surest because it does not change nor bend in any way, and it will forever stay that way.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>the rest of the steps üë£</h2>
        <p>Anchoring our faith to Him gets our foot in the covenant path. And through this path, we learn about the parts of our journey we must go through: the daily and sincere repentance of all our sins, bitterness, insecurities, inadequacies, frustrations and jealousy, the promise of a new life by immersing ourselves in the waters of baptism, and by seeking to be worthy of the companionship of His spirit through confirmation. These are ultimately the beginning of our eternal progression.</p>
