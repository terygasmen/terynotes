        <blockquote><strong>2 Nephi 9:14</strong> Wherefore, we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our guilt, and our uncleanness, and our nakedness; and the righteous shall have a perfect knowledge of their enjoyment, and their righteousness, being clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness.</blockquote>
        <p>this (<em>2 nephi 9:3-26</em>) is jacob touching and expounding on the intricacies of the plan of salvation. i love it because he went waist-deep into the resurrection part. this chapter can be taken apart verse by verse to provide an extensive expansion of the plan of salvation. jacob just gave us a master post of the gospel. ðŸ’¯ðŸ™Œ</p>
        <p>there's a predicated and eternal law that governs his kingdom and all of universe. and by that law, according to which his judgment of us is based, we shall have a perfect knowledge of how we've lived our mortal lives (<em>2 nephi 9:14</em>).</p>
        <p>so how will the judging on the day of judgment actually proceed? I have this question to pose for now: what is the perfect knowledge for if the judgment won't lie on us? there's no sentence; there is, however, the truthful realization on our part whether we are worthy to stay in his presence or not. his judgment is holy but through the perfect knowledge he's granted you, he'll let you do the executive decision on this one. will you be able to stand and stay in His presence and live with Him in happiness and joy or will your shame and regret stand in the way of you doing so? this one now falls on you.</p>
        <p>and with this, i'd like to touch on worthiness. this is crucial because the place closest to heaven here on earth are the temples; and before we enter the temple, we must go through a worthiness interview with our bishop and stake president. when asked if we are worthy to enter the temple, keep in mind that our answer will hold more meaning for us than for our leaders. will you still proceed to enter the temple even after the reminiscence of who you are?</p>
        <p>this question really is nothing more than a final reminder of repentance (have you repented enough in your preparation to enter the temple? is there anything left over for you to repent on?) because all members who plan to go to the temple will have made a conscious decision, many weeks or months before the interview and the actual going, to be clean and pure enough to enter. (<em>alma 40:26</em>)</p>
        <p>which brings me to a closing: he doesn't hold anything against us. we are the doers of that. ultimately, his kingdom is built on things that cannot be measured: by love and faith. these are things that are almost impossible to ascertain, if not subjectively. so, in the end, he will let his children discover on their own their worthiness to live with him in his paradise.</p>
