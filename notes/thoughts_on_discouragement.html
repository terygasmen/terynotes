        <h1>thougts on discouragement</h1>

        <p>As we progress through this mortal life, we will find the need to fulfill all of our responsibilities in every aspect: physical, financial, emotional, mental, social and spiritual. And when we find that we don&#39;t meet the definitive expectations shouldered upon us in these facets of life, we feel inadequate, discouraged and torn down. </p>
        <p>Holding the knowledge of our mortality and what we could become, it brings me great hope and comfort that (1) this is normal, everyone has an ultimate desire to pursue betterment in any way, shape or form, (2) everything will work out fine as this world and everything in it are temporary; new breakthroughs will manifest, industries will rise and fall, jobs will close and open, etc., and (3) there is a great source of power we can draw from in order to stand whatever challenge we face.</p>
        <p>I think that there&#39;s great comfort in knowing that our perspective is not complete. As humans, we are short-sighted, which makes it very easy for us to choose instant pleasure over delayed gratification, make wrong decisions and choices in our everyday life, feel discouraged when faced with challenges and trials, and hold false judgments to ourselves and to other people. It&#39;s even more comforting to know that one day, we will have evolved from this state to perfection.</p>
        <p>Of course, the prerequisite to this knowledge is knowing that this is only plausible through this one man who has atoned for all of mankind&#39;s sins--Jesus Christ. Can I just quote again this beautiful paragraph from the talk <em>The Atonement and The Journey of Mortality</em>?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The Savior has suffered not just for our iniquities but also for the inequality, the unfairness, the pain, the anguish, and the emotional distresses that so frequently beset us. There is no physical pain, no anguish of soul, no suffering of spirit, no infirmity or weakness that you or I ever experience during our mortal journey that the Savior did not experience first.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Isn&#39;t this so beautiful? To know that someone went through everything we have felt, feeling or will feel, all of it, just so He can say to us, &quot;I know exactly how it feels, and I know the way to heal.&quot; Because He does, and of course, He will show us the way to heal; not only that, He will show us the way we can be truly and fully happy. </p>
