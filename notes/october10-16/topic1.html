        <h1>october 10-16, 2022 | prophets are called to speak the lord's word üé∫</h1>
        
        <h2>foreordination üèπ</h2>
        <p>after the first four verses in the first chapter of jeremiah, we are immediately introduced to one of those doctrines that were only recently explicated in the latter days (with brigham young as the pioneer). it is the doctrine of foreordination.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 1:4-5 (NLT)</strong></p>
        <p>4 The LORD gave me this message:</p>
        <p>5 ‚ÄúI knew you before I formed you in your mother‚Äôs womb. Before you were born I set you apart and appointed you as my prophet to the nations.‚Äù</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>briefly, foreordination is one of the agendas that happened in the staple event of the grand council in heaven. it states that all who have had, have or will have their own callings were already called or ordained in the premortal existence, and they have their agency to fulfill these callings during their mortal existence, with agency as its contrasting factor from predestination.</p>
        <p>so in this verse, we have the lord comforting the prophet jeremiah of his brand-new calling. in the succeeding verse, we will see jeremiah&#39;s reaction to it.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 1:6 NLT</strong></p>
        <p>6 ‚ÄúO Sovereign LORD,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speak for you! I‚Äôm too young!‚Äù</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>sidebar: there&#39;s this natural man pattern of newly called prophets that i&#39;m grateful dr. john hilton iii brought into my view (this is from the follow him podcast with hank smith and john bytheway). it&#39;s these reactions we have when faced with a great challenge. </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>moses - &quot;i&#39;m slow of speech!&quot;</li>
            <li>enoch - &quot;i&#39;m only a lad. all the people hate me!&quot;</li>
            <li>isaiah - &quot;i&#39;m a man of unclean lips!&quot;</li>
            <li>jeremiah - &quot;i&#39;m only a child!&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>and i love how the lord deals with this kind of reaction, just as how he always deals with our imperfections: he doesn&#39;t tell us what we want to hear, he instead imparts to us the knowledge and the doctrine that supplements those worries, fears and insecurities, which not only comforts us but also validates our identity and potential. </p>
        <p>what he gives us are founded on an everlasting and unalterable truth, which hopefully teaches us a lesson on how to lift up our brothers and sisters when they&#39;re sad, lonely, hopeless or in despair. his approach is neither pampering nor tough love. it&#39;s wisdom. and this tells us what kind of person our god is. he is good and all-knowing.</p>
        
        <h2>how does the knowledge of foreordination bless our lives? üåü</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>TPJS, p. 365</strong></p>
        <p>every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the grand council of heaven before this world was. i suppose i was ordained to this very office in that grand council.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>the knowledge of foreordination is a vital doctrine in our church as it ultimately does these things:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>it indicates that there is indeed life before mortality which incidentally proves there&#39;s another one after.</li>
            <li>gives us strength to fulfill our own callings.</li>
            <li>the grand council that occurred in the premortal life is an inclusion of all god&#39;s children in the gathering of israel.</li>
            <li>simply proves that salvation is true and attainable.</li>
            <li>makes it easier for every member to sustain and follow our church leaders.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>personally, i&#39;m always stunned with the inclusion of everybody in the grand council, sustaining the  perfect candidates for the different callings and missions--positions that determine the trajectory of mankind in this mortal world. this gives me a window to a past decision i have done and the person i was in my premortal state. and now in my mortal state, i feel more confident in the called and ordained church leaders through the different time periods as they closed the gap of communication and knowledge between heaven and earth. but i digress üòó</p>
        
        <h2>what do prophets in our day &quot;root out&quot; or &quot;pull down&quot;? what do they &quot;build&quot; and &quot;plant&quot;? ‚õèÔ∏èü•Ä</h2>
        <p>this question is from the come follow me manual and i encourage you to ponder and answer this one on your own.</p>
        <p>different dispensations and ministries call for different sets of missions and knowledge. in these latter days, specifically the year 2000 when 
        i was born to the present, i have personally witnessed the decline of people desiring or even seeing the value in marriage and family. this is a big one for me and for the members of the church as we are stemming from the whole concept of exaltation (i actually made a whole post about this. ultimately, i talked about the role of collectivity in salvation, and partly on its premise, how it works and what it looks like).</p>
        <p>there&#39;s a steady increase of the pursuit of material things and successful careers. there&#39;s a rise in bitterness, toxicity and negativity; in the exploitation of our natural resources and neglect or even acknowledgment for the state of our planet; of mental health issues, emotional manipulation, unfaithfulness, lying and deceit; of the defiling of our bodies through different fashion trends, beauty standards and extreme diets; and more.</p>
        <p>and of course our ignorance is a huge player in this. it is only through knowledge that we gain a perspective that&#39;s not short-sighted, a lifestyle that&#39;s not self-indulgent, and a mindset that&#39;s founded in integrity and faithfulness. let me illustrate my point in these verses:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Isaiah 52:5-6</strong></p>
        <p>5 Now therefore, what have I here, saith the Lord, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the Lord; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.</p>
        <p>6 Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in the day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>as heartbreaking these verses are, we can find a valuable lesson in breaking them down into two parts: the problem and the solution. the problem is that these people are wicked and unrighteous. they blaspheme his name and mock his whole mission. they have completely descended into chaos and misery, deluded in their own idea of truth. and jesus was not happy about this. he&#39;s not happy about their spiritual state. in fact, he&#39;s grieving for what they have turned into.</p>
        <p>we go to the next verse where he tells us the solution to this ignorance: knowledge. the case is that their spiritual state stems from their lack of knowledge of their god and savior. to them, this man is another phony who self-elected his place to chastise their lifestyle and choices. these people simply do not know who he is. verse 6 tells us that come the future, when he returns as a resurrected and perfected being, the people shall know him and his name. they shall have that knowledge and they will hold on to it for their salvation.</p>
        <p>which now brings me to the important role of prophets in a world that&#39;s going further and further into destruction. there is only one driver of everything, and that is love. the plan of salvation, the atonement of jesus christ, the second coming of jesus christ, the allowance of salvation and perfection in the next life--they all came to fruition because of this driver. and that&#39;s essentially why we have prophets in every dispensation, to remind us what love is and all that manifested because of it.</p>
        <p>when we learn how to love properly and use this driver to live a righteous life, we will understand the value in families and the friendships we form with the people around us. we stop chasing after careers and fashion trends and beauty standards that will keep changing and contradicting. we will take responsibility of our stewardship to this beautiful planet. we take down all forms of negativity and lift each other up. we become faithful and honest to the ones we love. we build strong and faithful families that rise to the future generations.</p>
