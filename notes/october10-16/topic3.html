        <h1>october 10-16, 2022 | the lord will gather his people 👨‍🌾</h1>
        
        <h2>exodus will no longer be the talk of the town 🌊</h2>
        <p>parenthetically, we get these verses from chapter 16 where the lord states that israel&#39;s great history will no longer be the great big story.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 16:14-18 NLT</strong></p>
        <p>14 But the time is coming,” says the LORD, “when people who are taking an oath will no longer say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who rescued the people of Israel from the land of Egypt.</p>
        <p>15 Instead, they will say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the people of Israel back to their own land from the land of the north and from all the countries to which he had exiled them.’ For I will bring them back to this land that I gave their ancestors.</p>
        <p>16 But now I am sending for many fishermen who will catch them,” says the LORD . “I am sending for hunters who will hunt them down in the mountains, hills, and caves.</p>
        <p>17 I am watching them closely, and I see every sin. They cannot hope to hide from me.</p>
        <p>18 I will double their punishment for all their sins, because they have defiled my land with lifeless images of their detestable gods and have filled my territory with their evil deeds.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>there&#39;s a bigger and greater work that will commence from the scattering of israel and everyone will be a part of it.</p>
        
        <h2>knowing him 😌</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 22:13-16</strong></p>
        <p>13 And the LORD says, “What sorrow awaits Jehoiakim, who builds his palace with forced labor. He builds injustice into its walls, for he makes his neighbors work for nothing. He does not pay them for their labor.</p>
        <p>14 He says, ‘I will build a magnificent palace with huge rooms and many windows. I will panel it throughout with fragrant cedar and paint it a lovely red.’</p>
        <p>15 But a beautiful cedar palace does not make a great king! Your father, Josiah, also had plenty to eat and drink. But he was just and right in all his dealings. That is why God blessed him.</p>
        <p>16 He gave justice and help to the poor and needy, and everything went well for him. Isn’t that what it means to know me?” says the LORD.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>the lord likens king jehoiakim to his father, josiah, one of judah&#39;s righteous kings. jehoiakim is constructing his palace through slave labor while josiah lived modestly, devoting his time and energy to his people. this, according to the lord, is what it means to know him. no longer will you chase after the wrong things nor dedicate your precious time and energy to things that won&#39;t matter in eternity. </p>
        <p>in continuation to &quot;the weeping prophet&quot; section, in chapter 20, we get a scene of jeremiah reluctantly quitting his calling. he cried to the lord, saying:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 20:7-9 NLT</strong></p>
        <p>7 O LORD, you misled me, and I allowed myself to be misled. You are stronger than I am, and you overpowered me. Now I am mocked every day; everyone laughs at me.</p>
        <p>8 When I speak, the words burst out. “Violence and destruction!” I shout. So these messages from the LORD have made me a household joke.</p>
        <p>9 But if I say I’ll never mention the LORD or speak in his name, his word burns in my heart like a fire. It’s like a fire in my bones! I am worn out trying to hold it in! I can’t do it!</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>the last verse here really is the watershed moment for jeremiah. it&#39;s such a powerful testimony. after all the mocking, the ridiculing, the oppression, the threats, and the abandonment from his loved ones, he absolutely cannot give up. he knows too much of the truth now, that it&#39;s impossible for him to no living with it by the wayside.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>meditations, marcus aurelius</strong></p>
        <p>When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can&#39;t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil...</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>through this knowledge, the gospel comes in in one&#39;s life and changes it. change is what the gospel brings about. when we allows his hand to touch us, our lives change. when we allow his hand over our lips, we have his words; his hand over our hands, we have his strength; his hand over our hearts, we have his love. all he is is power.</p>
