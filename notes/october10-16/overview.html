        <h2>the book of jeremiah 📖</h2>
        <p>coming from the book of isaiah, the book of jeremiah is the lesser known account (at least for BOM readers since isaiah is the most quoted prophet by all of BOM prophets) that succeeds the scattering of israel through the assyrian conquest. in this book, we&#39;re treading towards the part two of the scattering through the babylonian conquest. </p>
        <p>we have just come from the destruction of the northern kingdom of israel, samaria, which contained the 10 tribes of israel (now called the ten lost tribes). we had a prophet named isaiah whose entire ministry was about the destruction of judah, or jerusalem, its great capital city. and about a hundred and thirty years later, with prophet isaiah gone, babylon is here as the new evil empire that follows the footsteps of assyria.</p>
        <p>i&#39;ll give three reasons why the book of jeremiah is a great book of interest among the many who are interested in the israelite history and in OT-BOM interrelations:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the book of jeremiah is officially the longest book in the whole biblical canon.</li>
            <li>it records the second and most important part of the scattering of israel.</li>
            <li>it is the entryway by which the BOM enters into view.</li>
            <li>jeremiah is a contemporary of lehi.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>jeremiah the prophet 🐑</h2>
        <p>jeremiah is the son of hilkiah, a priest in anathoth, benjamin (<em>jeremiah 1:1</em>). he is the succeeding prophet of isaiah. he comes in about 130 years after isaiah&#39;s prophecy of jerusalem&#39;s destruction.</p>
        <p>his ministry starts from the 13th year of king josiah&#39;s reign until the 11th year of king zedekiah&#39;s reign. in total, his ministry covered 5 kings of judah--king josiah, 3 of king josiah&#39;s sons, jehoahaz, jehoiakim, and zedekiah, and one of his grandsons, jehoiachin. (<em>jeremiah 1:2-3</em>)</p>
        <p>he is one of the major prophets (meaning his book has one of the longest running length in the entire OT canon), with his book, the book of jeremiah, the longest book in the entire biblical canon. and interestingly, scholars refer to him as &quot;the weeping prophet.&quot;</p>
