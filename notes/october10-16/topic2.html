        <h2>israel&#39;s cistern is filled ü•õ</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>jeremiah 2:13 NLT</strong></p>
            <p>13 For my people have done two evil things: They have abandoned me--the fountain of living water. And they have dug themselves cracked cisterns that can hold no water at all!</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>one of the prime symbols in the scripture canons is the fountain of living waters, where anybody can come and draw endless power and strength. fountains are known for their consistent and perennial flow and abundance, as opposed to cisterns where their capacity have a limit and the water can dry up and turn stale. to further clarify this symbol, i&#39;ll pull two scripture verses from the NT and BOM.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>revelation 7:17</strong></p>
            <p>17 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>in this verse, we learn that <strong>jesus christ is the path</strong> that leads toward this fountain.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>1 nephi 11:25</strong></p>
            <p>25 And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love of God.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>and in this verse, we learn that this <strong>fountain is the love of god</strong> which we know is unconditional and eternal.</p>
        <p>so israel made two wrong moves that ultimately led to the destruction of jerusalem. the word &quot;abandoned&quot; in <em>jeremiah 2:13</em> implies that the love and favor of the lord towards israel never departed nor ceased, and the part where it says &quot;they have dug themselves cracked cisterns&quot; shows that israel was the one who haphazardly turned disloyal and deliberately sought other gods. </p>
        <p>let me quote here a sidebar from hank smith in the podcast, follow him:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p> ...the Savior told a great parable about this when he said there was a house that had an evil spirit and they casted the evil spirit out and then it returns with seven of its friends because the house wasn&#39;t full of anything else. The sins returned with even more sins, with even more friends...</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>this is the great danger in trying to shift from a mindset/behavior to another. this is essentially what norman v. peale emphasized since it&#39;s such a simple error to make: while you&#39;re attempting tyou cao eradicate negative thought patterns in your brain, you can&#39;t leave it vacant. immediately, you fill it with positive thought patterns; otherwise, it becomes an empty vessel into which wrong thoughts might enter and inhabit. </p>
        <p>this is almost comparable to israel&#39;s futile attempts to jump on two branches, thinking they can get away with it in the eyes the one true god.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>jeremiah 7:4-11</strong></p>
            <p>4 Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, are these.</p>
            <p>5 For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;</p>
            <p>6 If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:</p>
            <p>7 Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>8 Behold, ye trust in blying words, that cannot profit.</p>
            <p>9 Will ye steal, amurder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;</p>
            <p>10 And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?</p>
            <p>11 Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the Lord.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>and i like to place these lines next to each other in <em>isaiah 29:13-14</em> where the lord describes the mismatch between what the israelites were practicing and what they were doing. i love this because isaiah and jeremiah are two completely different guys. we get isaiah who loves to articulate in beautiful prose and jeremiah who loves plainness like nephi. but their message is fundamentally the same. israel is preoccupied with their idol worships and violence and oppression so the spirit of the lord simply cannot dwell with them even when they go to the temple and worship him on sabbath days.</p>
        
        <h2>jeremiah, &quot;the weeping prophet&quot; üò≠</h2>
        <p>interestingly, jeremiah is referred to as &quot;the weeping prophet&quot; by some scholars. we find a fascinating narrative in chapters 11 and 12 where we see jeremiah battle with a crisis of his calling and capabilities, and comes to the lord to mourn. this reminds me of the entire book of job as job interrogates and almost berates the lord for all of his unfortunate circumstances. but to give you context, we read here what the calling and mission has brought to jeremiah&#39;s life.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 11:21, 12:6 NLT</strong></p>
        <p>21 This is what the LORD says about the men of Anathoth who wanted me dead. They had said, &quot;We will kill you if you do no stop prophesying in the LORD&#39;s name.&quot;</p>
        <p>12 Even your brothers, members of your own family, have turned against you. They plot and raise complains against you. Do not trust them, no matter how pleasantly they speak.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>people in anathoth, benjamin want him dead for all of his prophesying and chastisement. on top of that, his family doesn&#39;t believe him and has completely abandoned him. so jeremiah cries:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 12:1-4</strong></p>
        <p>1 LORD, you always give me justice when I bring a case before you. So let me bring you this complaint: Why are the wicked so prosperous? Why are evil people so happy?</p>
        <p>2 You have planted them, and they have taken root and prospered. Your name is on their lips, but you are far from their hearts.</p>
        <p>3 But as for me, LORD, you know my heart. You see me and test my thoughts. Drag these people away like sheep to be butchered! Set them aside to be slaughtered!</p>
        <p>4 How long must this land mourn? Even the grass in the fields has withered. The wild animals and birds have disappeared because of the evil in the land. For the people have said, ‚ÄúThe LORD doesn‚Äôt see what‚Äôs ahead for us!‚Äù</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>and the lord responds with:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 12:5</strong></p>
        <p>5 If racing against mere men makes you tired, how will you race against horses? If you stumble and fall on open ground, what will you do in the thickets near the Jordan?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>the lord gives us a disheartening response. and there&#39;s really nothing he can do. he knows what&#39;s ahead of jerusalem and its people. he knows what occurs throughout jeremiah&#39;s ministry. he had sent prophets to foretell what exactly will happen in the coming years of jeremiah&#39;s new calling. but jeremiah continues:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 12:15-18</strong></p>
        <p>15 Then I said, ‚Äú LORD, you know what‚Äôs happening to me. Please step in and help me. Punish my persecutors! Please give me time; don‚Äôt let me die young. It‚Äôs for your sake that I am suffering.</p>
        <p>16 When I discovered your words, I devoured them. They are my joy and my heart‚Äôs delight, for I bear your name, O LORD God of Heaven‚Äôs Armies.</p>
        <p>17 I never joined the people in their merry feasts. I sat alone because your hand was on me. I was filled with indignation at their sins.</p>
        <p>18 Why then does my suffering continue? Why is my wound so incurable? Your help seems as uncertain as a seasonal brook, like a spring that has gone dry.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>and it&#39;s only then do we receive a comforting response from the lord--that jeremiah&#39;s safety is assured. he may continue to prophesy unto the people of jerusalem and they will continue to endanger his life and go sideways:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>jeremiah 12:19-21</strong></p>
        <p>19 This is how the LORD responds: ‚ÄúIf you return to me, I will restore you so you can continue to serve me. If you speak good words rather than worthless ones, you will be my spokesman. You must influence them; do not let them influence you!</p>
        <p>20  They will fight against you like an attacking army, but I will make you as secure as a fortified wall of bronze. They will not conquer you, for I am with you to protect and rescue you. I, the LORD, have spoken!</p>
        <p>21 Yes, I will certainly keep you safe from these wicked men. I will rescue you from their cruel hands.‚Äù</p>
        </blockquote>
