            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>amos 8:11-12</strong></p>
                <p>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord:</p>
                <p>And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>the great apostasy (<em>amos 8:11-12</em>) represents the apex of what transpired before and during christ&#39;s reign, as well as what is happening today in the latter days. it is not uncommon for a person to edit his/her character, values, and beliefs, just as it is natural to self-actualize and better. in today&#39;s world, many do these by turning to different philosophies, material things, self-help books and many other temporal resources.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>isaiah 29:13-14</strong></p>
                <p>Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:</p>
                <p>Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>the lord addressed the disconnect of what the israelites were practicing and what they were doing (<em>isaiah 29: 13-14</em>). he predicted that the world&#39;s wisdom and intellect would be buried and perish. this simply implies that mankind continues to pursue what is desirable according to the standards of the world. if the israelites had their entire pantheon of baalim and asherah, we now have social media, toxic cultures of productivity, harmful eating habits, and many other things.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>d&c 1:16</strong></p>
                <p>They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth fold and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><em>d&amp;c 1:8-23</em> perfectly describes this condition. to quote a just brief part of it, &quot;<em>...every man walketh in his own way and after the image of his own god...</em>.&quot; i remember listening to a follow him podcast episode where john bytheway was discussing what/who we look to when we&#39;re sad or down. we may be unaware, yet this person or thing has become our god. we may believe that we are living the gospel, yet we rarely cry to him when we&#39;re hurt or think of him when we are happy.</p>
            <p>we now have access to the restored gospel, and the great and wondrous work is underway, yet we are not far from the worldwide spiritual condition that existed when jesus christ&#39;s early apostolic church ended. indeed, it takes the entire world&#39;s unbelief and wickedness for the lord to withdraw the gospel from our lives and the lives of future generations, but it only takes a single fiber of unrighteousness for us to spiral into apostasy.</p>
