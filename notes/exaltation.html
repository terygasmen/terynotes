            <h2>salvation is not an individual matter</h2>
        <p>i believe that gospel learners shake hands with the foundational principles and ordinances of the gospel with the initial assumption that salvation is a personal affair or an individual matter. one significant contrast the distinguishes the church from the world is its emphasis on families. the church is BIG on families while the world is slowly collapsing from a family-centric society to the embrace of individuality and extreme practices of independence. </p>
        
        <h2>the thing called exaltation</h2>
        <p>while individual salvation is one of the beautiful promises of the gospel of jesus christ, it is not all of it. there is such a thing called exaltation, and the collective salvation of mankind has a great deal to do with it.</p>

            <h2>the living and the dead</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>doctrine and covenants 128:15</strong></p>
            <p>15 And now, my dearly beloved brethren and sisters, let me assure you that these are principles in relation to the dead and the living that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation...</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>first off, we read in this verse the terms:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>the living</li>
            <li>the dead</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>in order to actually attain exaltation, we need to take into account the children of god who no longer reside in this mortal world. in expansion, his children are currently residing on three different planes of existence--premortal life, mortal life, and post-mortal life. without this acknowledgement, already we are down to saving only a couple of faithful covenant-makers-and-keepers on earth when there are still innumerable souls left on the margin.</p>
        <p>by doing the work of salvation on both the living and the dead, we are broadening the scope of salvation to all his children, not just the ones who are on earth. and this is his prime objective--&quot;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of men&quot; (<em>moses 1:39</em>).</p>

            <h2>we are arranged into collections</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>doctrine and covenants 128:15</strong></p>
            <p>15 ...For their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation, as Paul says concerning the fathers—that they without us cannot be made perfect—neither can we without our dead be made perfect.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>the second sentence in this verse is a crucial factor to consider in exaltation--that everyone&#39;s salvation is essential to all individual&#39;s salvation. consider another passage that fundamentally supports this truth:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>doctrine and covenants 38:27</strong></p>
            <p>27 Behold, this I have given unto you as a parable, and it is even as I am. I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>there&#39;s the implication here, in its plainest form, that individual salvation just isn&#39;t what heavenly father is looking for. that is not what he&#39;s after. what he desires is for ALL of his children to be saved. and there are several indications that prove this: </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>spiritually, we are born into one big family with god as our father and jesus christ as our brother</li>
            <li>mortally, we are born into families with a mortal father and mother</li>
            <li>as our aim, we are to be arranged into little zions, and eventually into one big zion</li>
            <li>the existence of temple sealing, both to our spouses and to our families</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>what this tells us is that the microblocks that build the kingdom of god are atomic families, not individuals. and atomic families are interconnected with each other, creating not a long chain, but a network of chains that run on faith, love and righteousness. if even one link is missing, the remainder of the network becomes disconnected, eventually incompleting the kingdom of god.</p>

            <h2>the fulness of happiness</h2>
        <p>lastly, i want to tie in the fulness of happiness and what it really looks like. take a moment to imagine whether true happiness exists in a life of isolation, in a world where individuals coexist but their lives simply don&#39;t overlap and depend on each other. there would be no need of systems, of language, of connections, or relationships. there would be no need for goodness and love. and while this life maybe easier, it would have been devoid of everything that we seek.</p>
        <p>although we have no notion of what true and complete happiness entails in our mortal state, we cannot deny that our survival, not only in this life but also in the next, necessitates the people around us for the attainment of joy, sustenance and progression. these are the marvelous and amazing intricacies of the lord&#39;s plan that stemmed out from his perfect love for us.</p>
