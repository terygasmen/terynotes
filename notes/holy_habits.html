        <p>It&#39;s fascinating to consider the disparity of our earthly experience compared to our other experiences in the past and come the future. For growth and even godliness to follow, what every disciple of Christ should adhere to is a workaround for the demerits of one&#39;s own natural man.</p>
        <p>One workaround is to shift from our psychological/existential point of view and revert to life&#39;s most palpable state--the building blocks of our earthly journey is our daily habits. Even in a life of spontaneity and inconsonance, there is no denying that our daily agenda projects the trajectory of our future.</p>
        <p>Parallel to that, the building blocks of a gospel-centric life are the holy habits. The holy habits, no matter how undecorated and infinitestimal they may appear, make the covenant path sustainable. At length, these activities are not unique to earthly existence as they prepare and provide us a picture of what our life looks like post-mortality. What we are essentially creating when these activities are exactly carried out, is a culture of faith, obedience and righteousness.</p>
        <p>The cultural and linguistic features of our life may differ from those of the Nephites, but the Lord continually upholds and facilitates these activities to be lived by every child of God. </p>
        <p>We read in <em>Moroni 6:4</em> that what kept the Nephites on the covenant path and thrive on it are three important acts:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>They remembered and were constantly nourished by the word of God.</li>
        <li>They were always on the lookout for opportunities to pray.</li>
        <li>They placed a high value on Christ&#39;s virtues.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These three points serve as an umbrella for the holy habits listed in the following verse (<em>Moroni 6:5</em>):</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Meet together often. (in these latter days, this would be on Sabbath day, at church: meetings, activities, councils, etc., on visiting our fellow brothers and sisters...)</li>
        <li>Fast.</li>
        <li>Pray.</li>
        <li>Talk about the welfare of each other&#39;s souls.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The last point is perhaps one of the most underutilized and neglected social activities in a church gathering. We often catch up by talking about the mundane areas of our lives to get a general sense of their each other&#39;s well-being; and while this is sensible and rather the norm, we should create more space for conversations that are spiritually enriching.</p>
        <p>Finally, because of our mortality, one of the most crucial constituents of our discipleship to Jesus Christ are reminders. In <em>Doctrine and Covenants 20:55</em>, we briefly broach on the subject of meetings/gatherings. I think this is such a simple and excellent way to provide room for individual and collective self-actualization, betterment and reflection. It is in those times of quiet and intentional rumination that we leave our natural man and meet with our spiritual man.</p>
