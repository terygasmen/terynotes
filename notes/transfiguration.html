        <h1>transfiguration</h1>
        <p>i&#39;ve really only scratched the top of the surface on transfiguration. although it isn&#39;t very new to me, it&#39;s one of those topics that fell to the wayside whenever i&#39;m doing a topic study. why is this necessary to include in the disclaimer (well more or less of what this is ðŸ˜¶, an inadequate introduction ðŸ™‚)? i want the record to show that i thoroughly enjoyed reading moses (especially chapter 1 and maybe 2 or 3 chapters more after that) because we have another close-up account of moses besides the 4 books we get from the old testament canon. and this supports the doctrinal truths about the many heavens, earths and adams (a tasty topic for all ages ðŸ˜ƒ).</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>moses 1:5</strong></p>
            <p>Wherefore, no man can behold all my works, except he behold all my glory; and no man can behold all my glory, and afterwards remain in the flesh on the earth.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>we start strong with verse 5 because right off the bat, we are introduced to the concept of transfiguration. briefly, humans can&#39;t stand the presence of heavenly beings; so in order for humans to do this, they need to be transfigured first, which is the process of lifting up a mortal being to a higher spiritual level so they can endure the presence of a heavenly being without dying (<em>transfiguration, guide to the scriptures</em>).</p>
        <p>and this is how moses explained his own experience of it:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>moses 1:11</strong></p>
            <p>But now mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld; for I should have withered and died in his presence; but his glory was upon me; and I beheld his face, for I was transfigured before him.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>then to circle back in verse <em>10</em>, we have the after-effect of transfiguration in which moses had to lie down as if dead for hours before getting back up again after the incident. then this is what he concludes after the experience, &quot;<em>now, for this cause i know that man is nothing, which thing i never had supposed.</em>&quot;</p>
        <p>these verses are a great read because it does not only teach us about transfiguration, it also poses this striking contrast of the mortiality of men and the immortality of god. there really is an ultimately higher plane of thought and existence.</p>
        <p>mosiah bears his testimony on this on <em>mosiah 4:11</em>. </p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>mosiah 4:11</strong></p>
        <p>...always retain in remembrance, the greatness of god, and your own nothingness, and His goodness and long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the angel.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>he almost sounds cynical here, but a deserving chastisement on the people nonetheless; because when placed side-by-side to Him, we don&#39;t even stand a chance. </p>
        <p>so here are a couple of anecdotes on transfiguration:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>causes the face to glow or shine (we have jesus and abinadi on this) </li>
            <li>beholding resurrected beings like jesus, peter, james and john (this would be joseph smith on the mount of transfiguration)</li>
            <li>fire is a heavenly symbol so being encircled by fire or something to that effect</li>
        </ul>
        <p>to conclude this, i can&#39;t help but form this phrase in my head: &quot;glimpses of heaven.&quot; i say this because it&#39;s not by luck that we get to witness an out-of-this-world greatness. it is by the strength of our faith. to me, these momentary glipmses of heaven are a testimony of our divine identity and potential to be perfected and resurrected and be gods and goddesses one day.</p>
