        <h1>thoughts on poverty</h1>
        
        <p>Our mortality is a unique experience in comparison to our premortal existence. In here, many shortcomings, misgivings and trials are attached. Poverty is one of most prevalent temporal trials that plague our world. It can also manifest in numerous ways in the various facets of our lives.</p>
        
        <h2>the corruption of poverty ðŸ¤’</h2>
        <p>Fighting off poverty is a tough and lengthy coure as it threatens the most fundamental aspects where our survival on this earthly journey lie.</p>
        
        <h3>its limitations ðŸ¦Ÿ</h3>
        <p>When you simply have no means to a safe community, you endanger the lives of your family and yourself. You begin to live in fear, rendering you disabled to favorable circumstances life can provide. When you lack the resources to pursue knowledge and education, you limit yourself to the many doors that will save you from this poor temporal state. When you have no access to food, nourishment, medication and professional help that will sustain your overall wellbeing, you risk your love ones and yourself the grief and pain that come with it. When you are financially poor, you lower yourself to a social standing and settle on the tightened corners of society&#39;s factional divide.</p>
        <p>Poverty is not just an individual- or family-scale impoverishment. It is a plague that progressively erodes our self-worth, the one that sits on the very heart of our behavior, deeds, desires and ambitions. </p>
        
        <h3>its dangers ðŸ’€</h3>
        <p>As we&#39;re plagued by this condition, we imperil ourselves to understanding and valuing life incorrectly. Because of the scarcity of temporal resources, your pursuit becomes the acquisition of these things. You might begin to place a greater meaning to money, obsess about mundane details such as a good and steady career, fantasize and romanticize a luxurious lifestyle, and make it your ultimate objective to gain a high social status, granting you access to the network of like-minded people&#39;s resources. And while these things are not necessarily evil, they mislead you into thinking that you are safe, secure and cocooned in the arms of the natural world which will soon crumble.</p>
        
        <h2>seeing poverty in a new light through the gospel of jesus christ ðŸŒž</h2>
        <p>However, if the gospel is at the front and center of everything that you do and have, you have a greater chance of seeing this opposition in a new light. </p>
        
        <h3>it is a teacher of faith ðŸŒ±</h3>
        <p>Poverty can be one of greatest teachers of faith. Through faith, He will give you the eyes of understanding, a lens that gives us the panoramic view of the universes He created. You begin to see the impermanence of everything in this earth, and realize that one day, you will have moved away from this mortal state and attain the highest degree of existence. Through the plan of happiness, you are freed from the constraints of your natural man and the natural world.</p>
        
        <h3>it is a teacher of hope ðŸŒ·</h3>
        <p>Poverty can also be excellent teacher of hope. It is only through our nothingness that you recognize the everythingness of your Father in heaven. Only by our lowliness does He open the windows and doors of heaven, showering you in abundance of blessings, gifts, and love you may never expect and comprehend.</p>
        
        <h3>it puts focus on the atonement of jesus christ âž•</h3>
        <p>Poverty can bring your eyes to the Atonement of Jesus Christ. You are brought to your remembrance of what He has done for you and for the world. His demoralizing mortal experience is not very far from yours, if not greater. He was subjected to all sorts of poverty and oppression. This is His journey to perfection. Because of this great sacrifice, godly power is available to you now, and most importantly, perfection and godliness in the next.</p>
        
        <h3>his love for you is abounding ðŸ¥°</h3>
        <p>The one thing you can be assured of is His great and unending love for you. He wants the best for you. He has a plan for you to be fully happy. Trust that this plan will never fail just as how everything in this world fails. He is all-knowing and the source of all power and intelligence. He has seen all your trials and challenges, and He has all of the workarounds for these intricately designed.</p>
        
        <h3>the remembrance of your identity ðŸ˜‡</h3>
        <p>Finally, when you remember Him, you must remember your identity. You are His child and you are worth more than all treasures in the world combined. you are molded from the exact same image of our Father in heaven, and you have the potential to be completely like Him someday, so place your hope in the surest foundation and you will overcome the world.  </p>
