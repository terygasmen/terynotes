        <h2>his ways are inconsistent? ü§î</h2>
        <p>before i became a member of the church, the one thing that i was so convinced the lord is is how arbitrary and inconsistent his ways are. it&#39;s evident to me now that this conjecture arose from the many churches that contradict each other, or even how the authors of the sciptures sometimes describe and explain things differently, and generally just how his teachings are perceived by people from different walks of life (i.e. faith with works vs faith without works, or baptism vs no baptism, etc.). </p>
        
        <h2>he is the source of all knowledge and intelligence ‚õ≤</h2>
        <p>this atomic apostasy in my environment didn&#39;t help shape my relationship with him and it wasn&#39;t until i visted the church for the first time that i was struck by the existence of its organization and authority that made me doubt my original preconceptions. the more i stuck with my membership to the church, the more i was met with the realization of how short-sighted i and everyone is. but the truth that i clung to the most is how he is the source of all knowledge and intelligence (<em>abraham 3:21</em>). and the thing about knowledge is that it can only be useful through an organization.</p>
        
        <h2>knowledge must be organized in order to be useful üóÉÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>there&#39;s a growing topic of interest among my contemporaries called &quot;the second brain,&quot; and what this is fundamentally is knowledge capture and management. it aligns with benjamin bloom&#39;s learning model of bloom&#39;s taxonomy where everything we pick up or &quot;capture&quot; becomes a point floating around or scattered elsewhere in our mental sphere, but in order for these information to be of any use to us, we must connect it to other points. these information can be anything from what we captured from the media, books, school, other people, or even our own experiences, thoughts/feelings/emotions, and so on. this fundamental act of thinking (which is basically just the sole act of connecting the dots) lies at the heart of our agency.</p>
        
        <h2>organization breeds a law that ultimately benefits all üåé</h2>
        <p>and with this comes a harmonious organization that makes this knowledge useful. if there&#39;s no organization, there would simply be no law. and a singular body that has no law would be devoid of structure, rendering it chaotic and inoperable, benefiting no one. it would just be an inconsistent mess. but we know the lord to be most the consistent, unalterable and eternal entity and power there ever is (<em>doctrine and covenants 76:4</em>). so invariably, he and his laws are operable because of this harmonious and unchanging organization (<em>malachi 3:6</em>).</p>
        
        <h2>the organization and laws of his kingdom üè∞</h2>
        <p>i love the quote given to us by elder bruce r. mcconkie from <em>a new witness for the articles of faith</em>, and i want to break it down for the sake of simplicity and clarity:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>the plan of salvation must come from revelation</li>
            <li>the revelation must come from a prophet of god</li>
            <li>members who perform saving ordinances must be called and set apart</li>
            <li>no prophet, no revelation</li>
            <li>no priesthood authority, no salvation.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>what we get here are simple and plain laws that run his kingdom. and the lord confirms this in <em>doctrine and covenants 132:8-12</em>, with the apex that his house is a house of order:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>that priesthood is what runs his kingdom</li>
            <li>that godliness is only attainable through priesthood power (<em>doctrine and covenants 84:21</em>)</li>
            <li>and that jesus christ is basically the entryway to godliness (<em>doctrine and covenants 132:12</em>)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>without these laws, nothing would ever make sense.</p>
