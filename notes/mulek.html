        <h2>who is mulek 🤠</h2>
        <p>mulek is one of those BOM NPCs that really captured my nerdity 🤓. of all of the OT and BOM books, there&#39;s really only one scripture verse that point to him as a person which is a shame knowing that the book of omni could have went on for more chapters to cover the significant events in his life and the sustenance of his people (from the 116 pages that martin harris lost, we know omni to be the second-to-the-last book joseph smith was translating and these lost pages, for all we know, could parallel the same accounts contained in the book of omni).</p>
        <p>other scripture verses that mention his name or point to/indicate his person either pertain to the city named after him (the city of mulek), his decendants (the mulekites or the &quot;people of zarahemla&quot;), or his ancestry (king zedekiah the last king of judah and his father, hamutal his mother, king josiah his grandfather, and his uncles king jehoahaz and king jehoiakim).</p>
        <p>i love this because it&#39;s one of those great examples of what OT-BOM tangents can do to tremendously help set the history straight: what the OT is missing, the BOM has, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>but to give you a brief overview of who mulek is, he is the only surviving son of king zedekiah, the final king of judah before it was destroyed by babylon. with other refugees from the war, he travelled across the globe and accidentally landed on the ancient americas, establishing this group of people called the &quot;people of zerahemla&quot; known in the BOM, or simply as the mulekites. years later, this tribe was discovered by king mosiah&#39;s men who were scouting the neighboring areas of the nephite land and discovered that both tribes descended from the seed of israel.</p>
        <p>we&#39;ll go in later to fill in the gaps and cover his ancestry since he descended from the royal line of the kingdom of judah where most OT authors make sure they&#39;re always recording for genealogy purposes.  </p>
        
        <h2>the final bits of jerusalem with king zedekiah 🛕</h2>
        <p>let me paint you a picture: we are in 587-86 BC, nearing the fretted and long prophecied babylonian conquest, and sitting on the throne as the vassal king of judah to the kingdom of babylon is the 21-year-old mattaniah, renamed as zedekiah, who freshly inherited the throne from his nephew, king jehoiachin.</p>
        <p>not only was zedekiah succeeding an entire kingdom (and not just any kingdom, but one that is pitted under the thumb of babylon&#39;s vassal treaty, which ultimately promises not to overtake as long as judah pays the agreed-upon taxes) at a young age, judah at this time was also in its worst shape spiritually, economically and politically, having had the previous king and many of his military men captured into babylon, leaving nothing but the poverty-driven civilians.</p>
        <p>here, we see israel slowly wading in at the end bits of its final and shameful downfall:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>babylon is growing in size by the day and they are sure to succeed whenever they choose to breach judah</li>
            <li>the young and newly appointed king is unfit to rule over what was left of judah in its defiled state and vulnerable military.</li>
            <li>judah&#39;s neighboring countries are preparing to invade any moment seeing the kingdom&#39;s poor state.</li>
            <li>and, lastly and the most important one, the favor of the lord, which we can account to for all of jerusalem&#39;s previous victories, only turns if judah repents, which, knowing the king and his royal lineage, won&#39;t bend to the one god they have forgotten many years ago.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>king zedekiah&#39;s sons were killed except for one 👶</h2>
        <p>as residents of the latter days, we already know what&#39;s ahead of judah, which, at this point, is all we have left of the political israel. we have the former prophet isaiah whose ministry is entirely about prophesying jerusalem&#39;s destruction and desparate convincing to the people to repent to turn things around. </p>
        <p>and, i&#39;m not about to go on how the whole judah-egypt-rebellion-against-babylon played out which, in brief, terminated the vassal treaty and commenced the invasion. so let&#39;s instead go to the bits where the city of jerusalem was finally breached. we read this in succession within four dismal and unsettling verses.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>2 kings 25:4-7</strong></p>
            <p>4 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king’s garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.</p>
            <p>5 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.</p>
            <p>6 So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.</p>
            <p>7 And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>to rephrase it: with the blue bloods of the city, zedekiah escaped towards the plain, was captured and brought to riblah. and in riblah, his sons were murdered in front of him, he was blinded and sent to babylon where he died.</p>
        <p>essentially, all we&#39;ve been exploring are the accounts recorded in the OT so i think it&#39;s time to bring in the one verse from the BOM that cross paths with these accounts.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>helaman 8:21</strong></p>
            <p>21 And now will you dispute that Jerusalem was destroyed? Will ye say that the sons of Zedekiah were not slain, all except it were Mulek? Yea, and do ye not behold that the seed of Zedekiah are with us, and they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>we read here, in its plainest argument, that there was one son who managed to flee and avoid being slain. his name is mulek.</p>
        <p>as we have initially established, this is the only verse that points to mulek&#39;s person, and not as the ancestor of the mulekites or as the city he&#39;s named after. it&#39;s a pity, since additional information about what type of person he is, how he fled the babylonian conquest, and how he traveled all the way to the ancient americas would have been fascinating. that must have been one blast of an adventure!</p>
        
        <h2>how many were his siblings and who were they 😶</h2>
        <p>i think i&#39;ve exhausted all of my scripture references and there are still a couple questions that remain unanswered:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>how many were his siblings and do we know anything else about them?</li>
            <li>was he politically involved during the reign of his father?</li>
            <li>how old was he when he escaped jerusalem?</li>
            <li>how did he land on the ancient americas?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>i&#39;ll briefly answer the questions posed above, but only through personal assumptions and other people&#39;s theories so if you managed to arrive at this part of the post, wade in with discretion 😉.</p>
        <p>in regard to question one, there is no definitive number in the scirptures or any other documents available out there that tell us how many of king zedekiah&#39;s children (much more their names) there were, but we do know he had sons (<em>2 kings 25:7, helaman 8:21</em>). we also confirm that he has daughters the majority of whom if not all fled the conquest and sought sanctuary in egypt (<em>jeremiah 43:6-7, 41:10</em>).</p>
        
        <h2>how old was he when he escaped the babylonian conquest 🚪</h2>
        <p>if we were to deduce on this prompt (but i promise you, we really don&#39;t have a lot to go on with 😕), we&#39;d have to start on a refresher of king zedekiah&#39;s timeline:</p>
        <p>we know that he sat on the throne of judah at age 21, and reigned for 11 years in jeruslaem (<em>2 kings 24:18</em>), but we really don&#39;t hold any information about his marriage or wife pre-ordination, much more on his children. in his 11th and last yaer, which makes him 32, jerusalem was besieged (<em>2 kings 25:2</em>). by this time, we know of his cihldren&#39;s existence--his sons and daughters.</p>
        <p>one inference we can make here if we&#39;re to follow the average betrothal age in the biblical times, he would have been wed by the time he was 18 to 20. newly weds were then to have their first child the following year. so even when we don&#39;t know the exact number of zedekiah&#39;s children, and what mulek&#39;s position is from among his siblings, the eldest child would have been between 13 to 17 years old by the time he was 32. this indicates that all of his children at this time were around their adolescent to pubescent years. this includes mulek.</p>
        <p>further on, by way of common courtesy that pregnant women and children go first, elderlies and women next, then men last, in a distress with a crowd involved, we have one inference on why the sons and the daughters of zedekiah were separated during jerusalem&#39;s besiegement. </p>
        <p>we may suppose that the daughters were in the ages 1-12, hence, they were included as refugees of the war, while the sons were in the ages 13-17, hence they ran off with their father to escape when there was no time to for everybody to be saved. </p>
        <p>as for mulek, it&#39;s hard to assume whether he was with his sisters as they sought safety in egypt or with his brothers in the plains of transjordan when they were captured and brought to riblah. however the most plausible scenario is that he was separated from his siblings along the journey which is why he was the only one who survived out of all his brothers and the only one who landed on the other side of the world from among his sisters. </p>
        
        <h2>was he politically involved during the reign of his father 👑</h2>
        <p>when it came to power alliances, king zedekiah was known to shake hands with edom, moab, the ammonites, tyre, and sidon who gathered in jerusalem to discuss and rise against babylon. we also know of ezekiel&#39;s prophecy in <em>jeremiah 44:30</em> concerning judah&#39;s collaboration with egypt. however, there is no evidence that the king&#39;s family was involved in judah&#39;s government in any way, shape, or form. and, following our assumptions on his children&#39;s ages, they would have been too young to get politically involved.</p>
        
        <h2>how did he escape judah and travel to the americas</h2>
        <p>we&#39;ve addressed his escape somewhat inadequately in the second question, so let&#39;s try to answer how he came to land on the ancient americas.</p>
        <p>there is one theory that says some phoenician sailors transported the mulekites to america. from there, the route they used was the route that columbus and other explorers took from the mediterranean. these sailors may have escorted them by sailing them across the mediterranean, through the iberian peninsula, and over the atlantic.</p>
        <p>another theory states that from the indian ocean to the southern ocean, across the southern pacific ocean to the west of south america, mulek and his group landed on the west coast of america. this is the same route that lehi&#39;s group took.</p>
